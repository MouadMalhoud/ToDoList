This project is a To do list app made with C# (windows forms) and mongodb. This version (1.0.0) is the MVP (minimal viable product) of the project. This means that the project is working minimally with the most important features to make it work. Updates are on their way ( make it more user friendly with drag&drops, more esthetic, integrate Api etc). 

When downlading the repos, make sure to change in dbuser.cs your string for mongodb and the name of the database.
